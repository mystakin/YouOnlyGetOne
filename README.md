Are you the one? Prove it! 

You only get one... Direction! In this game your character is only capable of progressing in a single direction. 

I also riffed on the idea of "one" in a more abstract sense. Each level has one item to collect, one base color in multiple shades, and the main character's design is... one of a kind. 

You Are the One is designed to be played with a mouse, but you can use a keyboard as well. 

-- Controls -- 

Left Mouse & "Z" -- Move / Move Left 

Right Mouse & "/" -- Jump / Move Right 

Middle Mouse & "Space" -- Restart Level 

Tilde "`" -- Skip Level (CHEAT)
